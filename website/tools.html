<h1>Managed Windows API Tools</h1>
<p><i>A collection of small applications that leverage the Managed
    Windows API library to provide useful functionality.</i></p>

<p>This file lists all tools in alphabetical order. Download them
  from the <a href="index.html#download">main page</a>.</p>

<h2>Accessible Object Explorer (AOExplorer.exe)</h2>

<p>This application mimics a screen reader application, but
displays the information on screen. Useful to capture text
that can be screenread but not copied, or to test screenreader
compliance of your own applications. You can also use them to 
check which AccessibleObject types are used by other programs
to make your own program more compatible to screen readers.</p>

<p>Can also be used as an example program for the 
ManagedWinapi.SystemAccessibleObject class.</p>

<h2>ClipHancer</h2>

<p>Enhances your system clipboard by keeping everything you ever
copied there (regardless of format) and allows you to paste it
later. Also supports some format conversions so that you can put
content into the clipboard in additional formats (and therefore avoid
pasting and re-copying the content into an application that supports
both formats). You can also send clipboard content to another computer
via the network, if your firewall settings allow that.</p>

<p>Acts as an example program for the ClipboardNotifier and Hotkey
classes</p>

<h2>ContentsSaver#</h2>

<p>Saves contents of text boxes, lists and trees as text files.</p>

<h2>DeskIconRestore</h2>

<p>Allows you to save Desktop icon positions and restore them
  later</p>

<p>Acts as an example program for the SystemListView class.</p>

<h2>GuessEXE</h2>

<p>Can "guess" which programming language has been used to program
  another EXE file. Take the results with a grain of salt. If you want
  to improve this program (if you write programs in another language
  that is not detected by this
  program) <a href="mailto:schierlm@users.sourceforge.net">drop me an
  e-mail</a>.</p>

<p>Uses the SystemWindow and the Crosshair class.</p>

<h2>Neat Keys</h2>

<p>Allows you to align windows neatly on your screen, both by keyboard
  shortcuts and with the mouse, using a small window popping out of
  the system tray. Useful for presentations in front of audiences
  that tend to be nit-picky about your messy screen layout.</p>

<p>Uses the SystemWindow and Hotkey classes.</p>

<h2>QuickMacro</h2>

<p>A very simple macro recorder to record a macro about something you
  need to do a lot now and never need it again</p>

<p>Acts as an example program for various types of hooks, for hotkeys
  and for the ShortcutBox class.</p>

<h2>ShootNotes</h2>

<p>Can make screenshots of parts of windows quickly and align them
  like "sticky notes" on your screen. Those notes remain on
  top. Useful, for exmaple, if you read a PDF file and often have to
  refer to an illustration in that PDF while you continue reading
  it. You can also draw onto those notes or add short texts.</p>

<h2>TreeSize#</h2>

<p>Check which files and folders eat your disk space. Slower than the
  original, but with more options.</p>

<p>Uses the ExtendedFileInfo class.</p>

<h2>Volume Fader</h2>

<p>Allows to change the system volume, and also fade it between
  different settings automatically.</p>

<p>Acts as an example program for the Mixer classes.</p>

<h2>Winternal Explorer</h2>

<p>Allows you to explore the internals (window handles, processes,
  accessible objects) of your system and modify their properties.</p>

<p>Acts as an example program for the SystemWindow and
  SystemAccessibleObject classes. Also useful to get properties of
  windows you want to track with your own application.</p>
