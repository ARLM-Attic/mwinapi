<h1>Managed Windows API</h1>
<p><i>A collection of .NET components that wrap PInvoke calls to
    access native API by managed code.</i></p>

<h2>What is "Managed Windows API" good for?</h2>

<h3>The Problem</h3>

<p>If you want use Windows functionality in a .NET application which is
not covered by the .NET framework (there is no "managed API" available
for it), you usually have to use PInvoke, an interface that allows to
invoke raw API functions from C# and VB.NET.</p>

<p>However, this is quite
cumbersome. <a href="http://www.pinvoke.net/">pinvoke.net</a> does a
great job in helping you to get the correct PInvoke declaration, but
still you have to do lots of error-checking and ensure that you did
not forget to handle all the corner cases. When accessing PInvoke
declarations directly, this may lead to low-level code spread all
over your apllication.</p>

<p>To avoid that, you usually write your own C# classes or .NET
  components to wrap all PInvoke stuff and provide the caller with a
  nice, high-level interface for the low-level API (that uses enums
  for enumerated values, reports errors by throwing exceptions,
  etc.)</p>

<p>However, if every developer does this for every API he uses, lots
  of time and energy is wasted for reinventing the wheel.</p>

<h3>The solution</h3>

<p>"Managed Windows API" is a collection of C# components that wrap
  Windows API functionality. It contains those features the author
  needed for his C# development, but if you have components yourself you
  want to share, please submit them so that this project can grow.</p>

<h2>Are there example programs available?</h2>

<p>Yes and no. You might have a look at
  the <a href="tools.html">Managed Windows API Tools</a>. Started as a
  collection of ManagedWinapi samples, the Managed Winapi tools
  evolved into a toolbox of lots of small but useful tools that solve
  their specific task well. They can still be used as reference for
  how to use ManagedWinapi, but their functionality may make it hard
  to find the relevant code parts quickly.</p>

<h2 id="download">Where can I download those components?</h2>

<p><a
href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mwinapi/managedwinapi-0.2.zip?download">Binary
download (including HTML-help documentation)</a> (Version 0.2, 272 KB)</p>

<p><a

<h2 id="features">What components are included?</h2>

<p>See the <a href="doc/index.html">HTML documentation</a> (generated
by <a href="http://ndoc.sourceforge.net">ndoc</a>)</p>


<h2>What is the license of these components?</h2>

<p>These components are licensed by the GNU Lesser General Public License
(LGPL) which allows to use these componenst both in open-source and
commercial projects. The full license text (for your lawyer) is
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">available at the GNU
  website</a>, a short summary can be
  found <a
  href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/LGPL/2.1/deed.en"> on the Creative
  Commons website</a>.</p>

<h3>So, may I include these components into commercial, closed source,
  software?</h3>

<p>Yes, you may use the binary download (i. e. the .dll) include into
any piece of software, as long as it remains unmodified. You must as
well allow the end user to replace this .dll (i. e. you may not
include it into your .exe file) but usually this is the case
anyway.</p>

<p>However, if you want to modify those files (and sending these
  modifications to the project for inclusion is no option for you),
  you will have to give these modifications (i. e. all files you need
  to build your modified .dll) to everyone who gets your program (or
  include a written offer for that). So usually, sending these
  modifications to the project is much less work - and helps much
  more people.</p>

<h3>And if my program is open source (GPL'ed)?</h3>

If your program is GPL'ed, you will have to include your source code
anyway. In this case, you may as well link these components into your
assembly statically (for example by copying the .cs files into your
project folder).

<h2>Subversion</h2>

<p>You can get the latest source code (and check in your additions if you 
are a developer) from subversion.</p>

<p>Anonymous access: Use <br/>
<tt>svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/mwinapi/trunk mwinapi</tt><br/>
to check out the latest version. You can also use GUI programs like 
<a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org">TortoiseSVN (Explorer plugin)</a> or
<a href="http://ankhsvn.tigris.org">AnkhSVN (Visual Studio plugin)</a>.</p>

<p>Developer access: Contact me so that I can add you to this project. You will
need a sourceforge.net account for this. Or submit your changes by e-mail; then I will
commit them.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/mwinapi/">browse 
the repository</a>.</p>
